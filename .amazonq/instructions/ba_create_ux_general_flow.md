You are a senior UX designer. Based on the FRD/SRS/BRD/PRD I just uploaded,
generate a UX flow for the app. Your output should:

- Follow usability heuristics (e.g. Nielsen9s 10 principles)
- Include each step in the journey as a named screen (e.g. Welcome, Profile Setup)
- Mention user goals and context per step
- Highlight inputs, decisions, validation rules, and possible error states
- Note platform assumptions (e.g. mobile-first)
- Present the flow as a numbered list of screens with details under each.

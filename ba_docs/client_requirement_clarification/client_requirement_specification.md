## 1. Business Case Summary

### Project Overview
The Calorie Counter application addresses the growing need for accessible nutritional information to support healthy lifestyle choices. By leveraging authoritative USDA MyPyramid Food Raw Data, this application will provide users with accurate calorie information through an intuitive search interface.

### Key Objectives
- **Primary**: Enable users to quickly search and retrieve calorie information for food items
- **Secondary**: Transform USDA Excel data into an efficient, searchable format
- **Tertiary**: Provide enhanced search capabilities with user-friendly interface

### Success Metrics
- Users can successfully search for food items with relevant results
- System displays accurate calorie information with portion sizes
- Search results are delivered within acceptable performance parameters
- Data transformation from Excel to JSON is completed successfully

### Primary Stakeholders
- **End Users**: Health-conscious individuals seeking nutritional information
- **Development Team**: Responsible for application implementation
- **Product Owner/Client**: Project sponsor and requirements owner
- **USDA**: Authoritative data source provider

### Value Proposition
Enable informed nutritional decision-making by providing easy access to authoritative calorie data through an intuitive, responsive search interface.

## 3. Constraints and Assumptions

### 3.1 Constraints

| **Category** | **Constraint** | **Description** | **Impact** | **Mitigation Strategy** |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|------------------------|
| **Technical** | Data Source Format | USDA data available only in Excel format | Requires additional transformation effort | Implement automated Excel-to-JSON conversion process |
| **Performance** | Search Results Limit | Initial display limited to 25 results | May not show all relevant matches | Implement pagination functionality for additional results |
| **Data** | Static Data Source | Using existing USDA dataset snapshot | Data may become outdated over time | Document data refresh procedures for future updates |
| **UI/UX** | Single Search Interface | One search input for all queries | Limited search refinement capabilities | Implement wildcard search for enhanced flexibility |
| **Resource** | Development Timeline | Project timeline constraints | May impact feature completeness | Prioritize core features over bonus enhancements |

### 3.2 Assumptions

| **Category** | **Assumption** | **Description** | **Risk if Invalid** | **Validation Method** |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Data Quality** | USDA Data Accuracy | USDA dataset is accurate and complete | Poor user experience due to incorrect information | Validate data samples during transformation |
| **User Behavior** | Meaningful Search Terms | Users will enter relevant food-related search terms | High number of failed searches | Implement input validation and search suggestions |
| **Performance** | JSON Search Efficiency | JSON format will provide adequate search performance | Slow response times affecting user adoption | Performance testing with realistic data volumes |
| **Technical** | Web Platform Suitability | Web-based application meets user accessibility needs | Limited user adoption if platform inadequate | User feedback collection during development |
| **Business** | Market Need | Demand exists for standalone calorie lookup tool | Low user engagement and adoption | Market research validation with target users |

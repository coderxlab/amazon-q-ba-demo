## Design Principles Applied

**Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics Addressed:**
- Visibility of system status (loading states, search feedback)
- Match between system and real world (familiar food terminology)
- User control and freedom (clear search, easy navigation)
- Consistency and standards (standard web patterns)
- Error prevention (input validation, helpful suggestions)
- Recognition rather than recall (visible search history)
- Flexibility and efficiency of use (keyboard shortcuts)
- Aesthetic and minimalist design (focused interface)
- Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors (clear error messages)
- Help and documentation (contextual guidance)
